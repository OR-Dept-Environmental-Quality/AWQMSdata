#' CuBLM
#'
#' A function that converts data from AWQMS long table format into the wide table format that
#' is used by the copper BLM model and the NPDES Copper BLM templates. Ancillary data is
#' the first data found in the calendar day. This is the same method used in 2018IR.
#'
#' Output includes the method detection and method reporting limit for Copper, as well as result
#' value and also the "Result_Type" for each characteristic so that
#' user can better judge the quality of the data. This function does not return data that has
#' a "Rejected" status in AWQMS.
